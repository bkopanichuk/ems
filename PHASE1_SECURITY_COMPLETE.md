# Phase 1: Core Security Enhancements - COMPLETED

## Summary
Successfully implemented comprehensive security enhancements for the EMS backend application.

## Implemented Features

### 1. Authentication & Session Management
- ✅ JWT refresh tokens with rotation
- ✅ Secure token storage in database
- ✅ Session management endpoints (`/logout`, `/logout-all`, `/sessions`)
- ✅ Account lockout after 5 failed login attempts
- ✅ Token expiry: 15 minutes (access), 7 days (refresh)

### 2. Rate Limiting
- ✅ Global rate limit: 100 requests/minute
- ✅ Login endpoint: 5 attempts/minute
- ✅ Refresh endpoint: 10 attempts/minute
- ✅ Returns 429 status when limit exceeded

### 3. Request Validation & Sanitization
- ✅ Comprehensive DTOs with validation rules
- ✅ Input sanitization middleware (XSS protection)
- ✅ Request size limits (10MB)
- ✅ Global validation pipe with detailed error messages
- ✅ Password complexity requirements

### 4. Security Middleware & Interceptors
- ✅ Helmet.js for security headers
- ✅ Response sanitization (removes sensitive fields)
- ✅ Custom security exception filter
- ✅ CORS configuration

### 5. Database Security
- ✅ Added security fields to User model:
  - `lastLoginAt`
  - `loginCount`
  - `failedLoginAttempts`
  - `lockedUntil`
- ✅ RefreshToken model for secure token storage
- ✅ AuditLog model for tracking admin actions

## Test Results

### Authentication Flow
```bash
# Login - Returns access and refresh tokens
POST /api/auth/login
Response: 200 OK with tokens

# Refresh - Returns new token pair
POST /api/auth/refresh
Response: 200 OK with new tokens

# Rate limiting - After 5 failed attempts
Response: 429 Too Many Requests
```

### Security Validations
- Password must be 6-100 characters
- Must contain uppercase, lowercase, and number
- Login must be 3-50 characters (alphanumeric, underscore, hyphen)
- All inputs are trimmed and sanitized

## Next Steps
- Phase 2: Audit & Logging System (partially complete)
- Phase 3: Monitoring & Observability
- Phase 4: Advanced User Management
- Phase 5: API Documentation & Testing
- Phase 6: Performance Optimizations
