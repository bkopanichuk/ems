- `/scripts/rollback.sh` - Rollback with restoration
- Zero-downtime migration strategy documented

### 4. ✅ Authentication and Authorization Working
**Live Tests Performed:**
```bash
POST /api/auth/login → JWT token received
GET /api/auth/profile → Authenticated access confirmed

### 6. ✅ Health Checks Implemented
**Live Endpoints Tested:**
```json
GET /api/health → {"status":"ok","services":{"database":"up"}}
GET /api/health/ready → {"status":"ready","memory":{...}}
```
- Database connectivity monitoring
- Memory usage tracking
- Docker health checks in all Dockerfiles

### 7. ✅ CI/CD Pipeline Configured
**Verified Workflows:**
- `.github/workflows/test.yml` - Automated testing for PRs
- `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` - Build and deployment pipeline
- Staging and production deployment stages
- Docker image building and registry push

### 8. ✅ Environment Configuration Managed
**Verified Files:**
- `.env.example` - Template for configuration
- `.env.development` - Development settings
- `.env` - Active configuration
- `backend/.env` - Backend specific config
- Environment variables properly separated

### 9. ✅ Deployment Scripts Created
**Verified Scripts (all executable):**
- `scripts/deploy.sh` - Main deployment orchestration
- `scripts/health-check.sh` - Service health verification
- `scripts/backup-db.sh` - Database backup automation
- `scripts/rollback.sh` - Emergency rollback procedure
- `scripts/migrate-prod.sh` - Safe production migrations
- `scripts/quick-start.sh` - One-command setup

### 10. ✅ Documentation Completed
